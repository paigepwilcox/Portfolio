					<h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
				</header>
				<p>When I began my college career I had ambitions to do research in cognitive sciences in hopes of helping those suffering from treatment resistant mental illness. During 2021 I decided I wanted to make a career change to something eequally as mentally stimulating and helpful as cognitive science. My friend turned me on to FreeCodeCamp and I started to have unprovoked "ah hah!" moments when doing mundane tasks like brushing my teeth. Once these moments started to occur I was hooked on learning more. I decided to invest financially into my learning and subscribed to Team Tree House. In June 2022 I found a highly competitive and intensive 11-month bootcamp with a 10% acceptance rate and chose to apply. I was admitted into this bootcamp in January 2023 and trained to become a full-stack developer. <br> I made this Portfolio as something to show for myself while my React Portfolio is under construction.</p>
